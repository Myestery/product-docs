# Single Sign-on (SSO)

Logging into your DevZero team can be placed behind your current SSO provider. Currently, the web dashboard isn't built out. But if you send an email to [support@devzero.io](mailto:support@devzero.io) with the following information, we can enable SSO for your team!

1. Sign-on URL (might be the same as [2])
2. Issuer (might be the same as [1])
3. Public certificate
4. Signature method (eg: `RSA-SHA256`)
5. Digest method  (eg: `SHA256`)

You can also create this as a [secret GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/) and send us a link!

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note...** We are aware that depending on the SSO provider you use, we might have to provide you a couple bits of information to put in your SSO Admin Portal. We will reach out to you if that's the case!
{% endhint %}
