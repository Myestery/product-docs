# Types of Recipes

Recipes are workspace specifications meant to serve as a golden path for workspaces. But while you're working on your recipes, you might not want to expose the work-in-progress to your team's recipe library.
For team's recipe, check out this section for [Creating New Recipes](new-recipe.md) or [Saving Recipes](saving-recipes.md).

This is when you should be using 'User Recipes' (will be called "unstaged recipes" soon). User recipes are only accessible to you.

## User (or draft) Recipes

You can see your draft recipes on the [My Recipes](https://www.devzero.io/dashboard/recipes#user) page.

The flow for this is exactly the same as teh flow for [Saving Recipes](saving-recipes.md). The only difference is that the toggle for team recipe needs to be **turned off**.
