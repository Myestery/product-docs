# Types of Recipes

Recipes are workspace specifications meant to serve as a golden path for workspaces. But while you're working on your recipes, you might not want to expose the work-in-progress to your team's recipe library.

This is when you should be using 'User Recipes' (will be called "unstaged recipes" soon). User recipes are only accessible to you.
