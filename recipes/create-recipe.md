1. From your [DevZero Console](https://devzero.io/dashboard), select `Create New` >> `Create New Recipe`. This will take you to the [new repo](https://www.devzero.io/dashboard/new/repo) page.

3. From here, you can choose to use a public Github repository by providing a URL or you can authenticate to our Github App to select a private repository.

If you're not using GitHub or prefer a different authentication method, check out this section on [cloning source code](clone-source-code.md).
{% endhint %}

4. Modify your recipe, then click `Save and Build` -- this will run a build to ensure the recipe builds successfully. Also, we provide suggested recipe steps based on introspecting your code to make building a recipe faster and easier.

5. We provide detailed build logs to help you identify any errors in your build and make iterating on Recipes easy.

5. After you've successfully build your Recipe and are done iterating, you're ready to Publish the recipe to your Recipe Library.
