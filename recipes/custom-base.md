# Custom base images

{% hint style="info" %}
**Coming soon...**
{% endhint %}

Recipes currently don't support using custom base images. We use ubuntu:22.04 as our base OS for all our recipes and workspaces. 
We are aware that we need to support custom base images and this page will be updated once that's a reality (ETA: Summer 2024).

Use cases:
- Already built dockerfiles with a collection of internal tools and dependencies.
- Security of the base image that's used.
- If there are others that we're missing, please drop us a note at [support@devzero.io](mailto:support@devzero.io)
