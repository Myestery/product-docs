# Creating a new recipe

## Using the web dashboard

{% hint style="info" %}
_If you want to use the CLI tool instead, please visit [this section](#using-the-dz-cli-tool)._
{% endhint %}

1. A recipe always start from a repository. To get started, first visit the [DevZero Console](devzero.io/dashboard). 

2. Create a recipe by clicking `Create New` (top-right) >> `Create New Recipe`. This will take you to the [new repo](https://www.devzero.io/dashboard/new/repo) page.

3. Either start typing or enter the URL of any repo hosted on GitHub (eg: `https://github.com/vercel/vercel`).

4. Modify your recipe, then click `Save` (top-right).

5. Give the recipe a name and description (so you can find it later!), **check the toggle** for team recipe, and save it! To save it as a draft recipe, see the ['User Recipes' section](types.md#user-or-draft-recipes).

## Using the `dz` CLI tool

{% hint style="warning" %}
_This section is undergoing active development and will change in the near future._
{% endhint %}

1. Install the CLI tool if you haven't installed it already by following the [Download CLI](../getting-started/install-devzero/download.md) page.

2. `cd` into your repository directory on your local machine and run
{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```bash
dz workspace suggest
```
{% endcode %}

3. Inspect the contents and this time, write the contents to a file called recipe.yml
{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```bash
dz workspace suggest > recipe.yml
```
{% endcode %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Be sure to set up your GitHub provider before continuing to the next step. If you're not using GitHub, check out this section on [custom cloning source code](code.md#advanced-custom-ways-of-clone-code).
{% endhint %}

4. Run a build for the specification
{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```bash
dz workspace build --recipe-file=recipe.yml
```
{% endcode %}

5. Once the build completes, there will be output that looks like this
{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```bash
ðŸš€	Build was successful!
ðŸ‘‰	To launch a workspace from this build:
		dz workspace create --build-id build-f10bafd5ee0a4fba91ff6bba54f23e9c --recipe-id recipe-9a33ea10b2554b00ae7e73c02b341048
```
{% endcode %}

6. Now that you have a valid build, you can save this as a recipe. Copy the contents of `recipe.yml` and continue from step 3 in the [Web Dashboard](#using-the-web-dashboard) section.
