# Saving Recipes

Recipes are workspace specifications meant to serve as a golden path for workspaces. To enable your teammates to use recipes that you have built, add them to the team's recipe library. 

To maintain a library of unstaged recipe specifications, use the 'User Recipes' section.

1. Create a recipe by clicking `Create New` (top-right) >> `Create New Recipe`
