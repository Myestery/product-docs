# Sharing Recipes

Recipes are private by default, meaning that they will only be available to the authoring user. To enable your teammates to use recipes that you have built, update the recipe to add it to your team's [recipe library.](../references/terminology.md#recipe-library)&#x20;

**Here's how to do that:**

1. Create a recipe by clicking `Create New` (top-right) >> `Create New Recipe`

2. Modify your recipe, then click `Save` (top-right)

3. Give the recipe a name and description, **check the toggle** for team recipe, and save it!

4. Visit the [shared recipes](https://www.devzero.io/dashboard/recipes#shared) page, to verift that the recipe has been saved!
