# Accessing your teammates workspace

The flow for this is exactly the same as the one for [Accessing your workspace](access-own-workspace.md). 

The only difference is, in order to see your teammates workspace, run (note the `--team` flag)
{% code overflow="wrap" lineNumbers="true" %}
```bash
dz network status --team
```
{% endcode %}

The rest of the steps are exactly the same!
